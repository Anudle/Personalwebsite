    <h4>Coding Goals</h4>
    <p class="future">
I’m thrilled to be at Galvanize, where I’m not only excited to learn how to program,
but also have the chance to meet great people. Although I’ve never had any formal
training for coding, I expect to inch along the process, slowly but surely picking
up steam. My goals after Galvanize are to successfully create a website that
helps parents choose a college savings program and promote a collaborative team
environment wherever I go.
